## Pattern unification

This file implements a unification algorithm for the matching patterns defined
by the framework. This is mainly used with PDL rewrites, where we unify the
rewrite's matching pattern with the dialect-provided matching patterns for all
the instructions targeted by the rewrite, in order to propagate operations
invariants that are implicit in PDL.

### Unification equalities

These are simply typed equalities which make up the core of a unification
problem. They can be constructed mistyped, but we check them.

### Unification problem

The Unification structure, representing a whole unification problem, tracks a
number of elements related to the resolution, including the original set of
equations and the substitutions that form the most general unifier.

  -- Original set of equations
  initial_equations: List (UEq δ) := []

  -- Substitutions performed so far. These are restricted to have variables as
  -- the left hand of every equality.

### Unification algorithm

We use a naive unification algorithm. Given the size of the patterns at play,
performance is not a real concern, and instead we prefer to have a more natural
traversal of the structure that leads to more intuitive logs and error
messages.

This is algorithm 1 of [1], which essentially normalizes the set of equations
through a number of unifier-preserving transformations.

For maintenance reasons, we log the progress of the algorithm as we go. Most of
the functions return IO (_ × Bool) or IO (Option (_ × Bool)); IO is obviously
for logging; the Bool is to indicate whether progress was made; and the Option
is set to none when the problem is found to be unsatisfiable.

### Algorihm description

We run the rules below till fixpoint:
  1. Remove x = x.
  2. If we have `x = term`, and there are no cycles, we substitute.
  3. If we have `term = x`, we re-orient to `x = term`.
  4. If we have `constructor(a1, ... ak) = constructor(b1, ... bk), we add
     equalities `ai = bi`.
  5. Make sure that we have substitution priority right.

### Basic example

Here, we consider an under-specified [x*2] pattern (ex_root) that we presumably
want to turn into [x+x]. The pattern doesn't specify that x is an i32 as this
is implicit, and we uncover this fact by unifying with the general shape of a
multiplication operation (mul_pattern), supposedly obtained from IRDL.
